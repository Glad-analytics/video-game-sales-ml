# video-game-sales-ml
Supervised and unsupervised learning to analyse and predict video game sales performance.
## Project Overview
This project explores how supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be used to understand and predict the global sales performance of video games. The dataset includes information such as platform, genre, publisher, user ratings, and global sales.

## Role
Data Scientist / ML Analyst

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Keras (Sequential, Adam Optimizer)

## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed a video game sales dataset from Kaggle.
- Built supervised learning models to predict global sales (regression).
- Applied unsupervised learning (KMeans) to identify clusters based on sales and metadata.
- Built Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that predicts global sales
- Performed EDA to identify top-performing genres and platforms by region.
- Visualized trends and model performance using bar plots, scatterplots, and heatmaps.
